      "value": "<p>A creature for medium- or larger area farmers, pigs breed relatively quickly and are sturdy creatures that provide all manner of cooking possibilities for the enterprizing cook, foremost of which is of course bacon. Their skin can also be used as a cheaper leather, but it is less tear-resistant compared to lamb or goat. Pigs are also the source of lard.</p>\n<p>Most pigs weigh between 250 and 270 pounds at slaughter as it gives optimal retail cuts and medium fat covering.</p>",
