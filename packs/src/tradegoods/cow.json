      "value": "<p>A creature for large-area farmers, cows require large areas of flat grazing meaning they are not as common as other livestock. However, they live longer, and give far more milk. They are also a source for much more durable leather that is less prone to cracking and is resistant to heat and dirt.</p>\n<p>Depending in the gender and breed, adult cows can weigh between 1,000 and 1,800 pounds.</p>",
