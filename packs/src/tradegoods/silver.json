      "value": "<p>Silver has long been appreciated for its unreactive nature and ease with which it can be shaped into the finest of decorations, adornments, and of course used as coin.</p>\n<p>Silver is rarely found in its native form in nuggets. Normally it is found mixed with other substances like sulfur or chlorine, in ores, or as an alloy with the likes of gold. Surface silver can be found, but is much more commonly mined underground. Silver mining is lucrative and can inspire silver-rushes.</p>",
