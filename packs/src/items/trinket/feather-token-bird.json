      "value": "<p><em>Wondrous item</em></p><p>This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly from the @Compendium[mka.tables.OEdr086W61t1DRJo]{Feather Token} table.</p><p><strong>Bird.</strong> You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a @Compendium[mka.monsters.p980augbCIdpK9ZX]{Roc}, but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p><section class=\"secret foundry-note\" id=\"secret-MSLq8LtzkIiyNC0O\"><p><strong>Foundry Note</strong></p><p>The 144 charges represent the 144 miles the bird can travel when being able to travel at maximum speed to enable accurate distance-tracking as required.</p></section>",
