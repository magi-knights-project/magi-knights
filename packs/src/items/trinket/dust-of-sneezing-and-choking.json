It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an <em>@Compendium[mka.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{Identify} </em>spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.</p>\n<p>When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The @Compendium[mka.spells.F0GsG0SJzsIOacwV]{Lesser Restoration} spell can also end the effect on a creature.</p>",
